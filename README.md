The circuit description file was made based on this hand drawn schematic:

The amplifier in the circuit was modelled using a Voltage Dependent Voltage Source (E1), the output voltage is limited as in real world amplifiers using the table option.

Te diodes and voltage sources introduce non-linearity which is a essential part of the circuit.

## Ring Modulator

This is a classic ring modulator with 4 diodes. The circuit multiplies two signals creating new sum and difference frequency components at it's output.
