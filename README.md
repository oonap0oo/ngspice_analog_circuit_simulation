## [Chua's circuit](chua_circuit_6.sp)

This circuit desciption runs a version of Chua' circuit which shows chaotic behavior.

This plot generated by ngspice shows two voltages in the circuit in a x-y plot.

The circuit description file was made based on this hand drawn schematic:

The amplifier in the circuit was modelled using a Voltage Dependent Voltage Source (E1), the output voltage is limited as in real world amplifiers using the table option.

Te diodes and voltage sources introduce non-linearity which is a essential part of the circuit.
